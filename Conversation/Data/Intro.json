Andrew, who ranks #9 WarDancer player in the world, thinks it’s a waste of time painting carefully on the pieces. If I remember it correctly, he is on the dean's list of Economics Department. Killi, my roommate , also an art student, really like the painting on his pieces. I do not understand, but it does not matter much.)"},
